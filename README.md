# Tableau-01
This image appears to be a Tableau dashboard that combines multiple global data visualizations, focusing on four key sectors: **fuel**, **communication**, **internet**, and **health**. Here‚Äôs a deeper breakdown of each component:

---

### üî• **Fuel (Top-Left Map Visualization)**
- **Data Displayed**: Fuel exports as a percentage of merchandise exports.
- **Visualization**: A world map with color gradients representing the extent to which countries rely on fuel exports.
- **Interpretation**:
  - Darker blue regions (e.g., Russia, Middle East, parts of Africa) have a higher dependency on fuel exports.
  - Lighter areas (e.g., much of Europe, some of Asia and Africa) rely less on fuel for export revenue.
- **Purpose**: To show economic dependency on fuel exports geographically.

---

### üìû **Communication (Top-Right Bar and Line Graph)**
- **Data Displayed**: Trends in:
  - Fixed telephone subscriptions (orange bars).
  - Fixed broadband subscriptions (blue line).
- **Time Period**: 2008 to 2018.
- **Trends**:
  - **Telephone subscriptions** are gradually **declining**.
  - **Broadband subscriptions** are **increasing** steadily.
- **Insight**: Reflects the global technological shift from traditional telephony to digital communication infrastructure.

---

### üåê **Internet (Bottom-Left Bar Graph)**
- **Data Displayed**: Percentage of population using the Internet in selected countries.
- **Top Countries**:
  - Iceland, Norway, Denmark, Luxembourg, and Sweden lead, showing high levels of internet penetration.
  - Korea, Rep. is included but uses a distinct color (red) to likely signify its Asian region (as seen in the legend).
- **Purpose**: Highlights digital access and connectivity by country, suggesting strong digital infrastructure in Europe and parts of Asia.

---

### üè• **Health (Bottom-Right Bubble Scatter Plot)**
- **X-Axis**: Population ages 65 and above (% of total population).
- **Y-Axis**: Life expectancy at birth.
- **Bubble Size**: Represents **current health expenditure** (larger bubbles = more spending).
- **Notable Countries**:
  - **Japan** stands out with high elderly population and long life expectancy.
  - **Lesotho and Chad** show low life expectancy, indicating health challenges.
  - **Qatar, Israel, Lebanon** have relatively high life expectancy and moderate elder population.
- **Purpose**: To show relationships among aging populations, life expectancy, and healthcare investment.

---

### üìä **Legends and Labels**
- **Region Color Codes**: Help distinguish data points on regional basis (Africa, Americas, Asia, Europe, Oceania).
- **Measure Names**: Differentiate between fixed broadband and telephone subscriptions.
- **Health Bubble Size**: Indicates the magnitude of health expenditures by country.

---

### üß† **Overall Insights**
- The dashboard presents a comparative view of global development indicators.
- It allows for cross-sector analysis (e.g., does health expenditure correlate with life expectancy? Do countries with high internet use also have high broadband subscriptions?).
- Regional disparities are visually evident across all sections.
